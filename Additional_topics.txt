1. Law of Large numbers -> if we toss a coin 10 times the ideal probablity of getting an head is 
   50% but the result you get will be different. It can be 4/10 or 3/10. This law states that if
   the event is repeated many times or equals infinity then Actual probablity will tends to Ideal 
   probability.

   Ideal Probability - I(E) - 0.5
   N(E)number of times    Getting a head   Probablity P(E)
     10                   4             0.4
     100                  45            0.45
     1000                 490           0.49
if N(E) ~ infinity  then P(E) ---> I(E)
